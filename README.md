### About
The 1-Translate app is a calculator that can display (and read) numbers in serval languages.

### Bugs
If you find a bug in the app, you can try to identify a wrong or missing test in the test file Test*.swift that corresponds to the language and open an issue in this repository.
These file are in the folder Test.

### Adding new languages
The best way to ask me to add a new language would be to provide me with a Test*.swift file that covers most of the standard numbers plus irregular behavior. You could create a pull request - or simply attach the test file for the new language to a new Github issue.
